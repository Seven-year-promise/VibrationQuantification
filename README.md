## Quantification Platform for Touch Response of Zebrafish Larvae using Machine Learning

- Paper link: https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000140195

## The functions of this code

- Quantification of the data collected by [Touch-Response data acquisition platforms](https://github.com/Seven-year-promise/MultiFishTouchResponse);
- Visualization of the quantification results.

## This code is implemented by Python, and uses the following (parts) libraries:

- tensorflow-gpu==1.15.0
- torch=1.4.0
- scikit-learn==0.23.1
- scipy==1.6.0
- seaborn==0.12.2
- pyqt5-sip==4.19.18

## How to use the repostory

- Install the environment according to `environment.yml`.
- Change the path of the data and the path to save the quantification results in `config.py`: `QUANTIFY_DATA_PATH`, and `QUANTIFY_SAVE_PATH`.
- DO the quantification by

    `python quantification.py`
    
- Visulization of the results can be done by `./QuantificationResults/FigureDraw.py`
- Pattern analysis of the quantification reusults can be done by `./HTS/`
